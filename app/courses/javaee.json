The EE stands for <b>Enterprise Edition</b> (as opposed to the <b>Standard Edition</b> Java SE, which primarily focuses on desktop and workstation applications). Java EE provides APIs that can be used for Java developers to implement features that Enterprise application typically need. And secondly, it provides a platform to run the applications on. Code written with Java EE APIs will run on any Java EE certified application server.</p><p>The courses on this page cover various technologies and APIs that can be used to write Enterprise Java applications. </p>",
